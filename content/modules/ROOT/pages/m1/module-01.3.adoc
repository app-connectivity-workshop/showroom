== Activity: Complete the access configuration
{m1}

Recall the access token you created earlier in OpenShift. In a typical scenario, you would download and transfer this token from OpenShift directly to your RHEL server. However, in this **workshop setting** (where you might have limited access to the local file system or download capabilities), we'll use a script to convert the cluster-stored grant into a token and transfer it to the RHEL server. 

NOTE: This script is solely for the convenience of this workshop and isn't required when using {rhsi} in production environments.

=== Transfer secure token from OpenShift to RHEL

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to convert the grant to a token and save it to a file. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/scripts/refs/heads/main/m1/convert_grant_token.sh | bash > summit_token.yaml
----

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to transfer the token file (from the previous step) to the RHEL server.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
scp summit_token.yaml lab-user@{rhel_hostname}:/home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/
----


.. Type *yes* and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*
+
image:m1/execute-script.png[] 
.. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

.. Enter the RHEL password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted.
 
=== Start Virtual Application Network on RHEL

. Since the token has now been transferred to the RHEL server, start the Virtual Application Network by running the command below from the *RHEL terminal (lower terminal)*.

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]

[CAUTION]
====
.Click if you are facing an error - `bash: skupper: command not found`
[%collapsible]
=====
You might have been logged out of the RHEL server.

. Log in to the RHEL server using the following command using the *lower terminal*.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 \
    -o ServerAliveCountMax=60 lab-user@{rhel_hostname}
----
. Type `yes` and hit enter if prompted by the message `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?`

. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

. Enter your password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted and press *Enter*.
