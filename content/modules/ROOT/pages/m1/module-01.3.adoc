== Activity: Complete the access configuration
{m1}

Recall the access token you created earlier in OpenShift. In a typical scenario, you would download and transfer this token from OpenShift directly to your RHEL machine. However, in this **workshop setting** (where you might have limited access to the local file system or download capabilities), we'll use a script to convert the cluster-stored grant into a token and transfer it to the RHEL machine. 

NOTE: This script is solely for the convenience of this workshop and isn't required when using {rhsi} in production environments.

=== Transfer secure token from OpenShift to RHEL

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to convert the grant to a token and save it to a file. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/scripts/refs/heads/main/m1/convert_grant_token.sh | bash > summit_token.yaml
----

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to transfer the token file (from the previous step) to the RHEL machine.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
scp summit_token.yaml lab-user@{rhel_hostname}:/home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/
----


.. Type *yes* and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*
+
image:m1/execute-script.png[] 
.. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

.. Enter the RHEL password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted.
 
=== Start Virtual Application Network on RHEL

. Since the token has now been transferred to the RHEL machine, start the Virtual Application Network by running the command below from the *RHEL terminal(lower terminal)*. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
skupper system setup
----

. Wait for a few seconds, and you should see the following output.
+
[source,sh]
----
Sources will be consumed from the namespace "default"
Site "rhel" has been created on namespace "default"
Platform: podman
Definition is available at: /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources
