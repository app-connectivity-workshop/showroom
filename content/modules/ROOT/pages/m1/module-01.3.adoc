== Activity: Transferring a secure token to RHEL

Recollect the access token that you created in the previous steps. Ideally you would download the token and directly transfer that token to your RHEL machine. But in a workshop setting (where you might not have access to download the token), we will use a script to convert the grant(available as a resource on the cluster) into a token format and transfer it to the RHEL machine.

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script to convert the grant to a token

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpscodes/app_connectivity_summit25/refs/heads/main/convert_grant_token.sh | bash > summit_token.yaml

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following script toTransfer the token file to the RHEL machine.

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
scp summit_token.yaml lab-user@{rhel_hostname}:/home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/

.. Type *yes* and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*

.. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

.. Enter the RHEL password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted.
 
. Since the token has now been transferred to the RHEL machine, let's start the Virtual Application Network by running the command below from the *RHEL terminal(lower terminal)*.
