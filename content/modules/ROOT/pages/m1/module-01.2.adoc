== Activity: Setting up the site on RHEL
Similar to our OpenShift site, we will setup the site and routers on RHEL. We will using the Red Hat Service Interconnect command line interface to setup the site. 

We'll ssh into our on-prem RHEL machine using the in built Terminal to the right. 

. Click on the lower terminal on the bottom. 
+

. Login to the RHEL machine using the following command.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=60 lab-user@{rhel_hostname}
----


. Type *yes* and hit enter if prompted by the message *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*

. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

. Enter your password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted and press enter.

. You should now be logged into the RHEL machine. Let's see how we can setup a link between the database and the OpenShift cluster.

. Your terminal setup should look like the below.
+
image::m1/terminal_upper_lower.png[]

. Enter the following command to clear the *RHEL terminal window (lower terminal)*
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
clear
----

. First let's verify if the database is running on the RHEL machine. From the *RHEL terminal window (lower terminal)*, run the following command.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
podman ps
----

. You should see an output like the below.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS    NAMES 
3d12164dd54b  quay.io/kiali/demo_travels_mysqldb:v1  --default-authent...  4 hours ago  Up 4 hours  0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 3306/tcp, 33060/tcp  travels-mysqldb
----
+
Note: In case the output returns an empty list, it means that the database is not running on the RHEL machine. Run 'podman restart travels-mysqldb' to restart the database. 

. In the *RHEL terminal window (lower terminal)*, run the following command to create a site. Similar to our OpenShift site, this will setup the routers in the namespace.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
skupper site create rhel
----

. You should see the following output.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
File written to /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/sites/rhel.yaml
----

. Next let's learn what a connector is.
+
[.concept]
.What is a connector?
****
A connector binds a local workload to listeners in remote sites. Listeners and connectors are matched using routing keys. Each connector has an associated workload and routing key. The workload can be specified as a Kubernetes pod selector or as the host and port of a local network service. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the connector to listeners in remote sites.

On Kubernetes, the workload is usually specified using a pod selector. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, it is specified using a host and port.

. In the same *RHEL terminal window (lower terminal)* , run the following command to create a connector.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
skupper connector create mysqldb 3306 --host 127.0.0.1 -r appconn
----

. You should see the following output.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
File written to /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/connectors/mysqldb.yaml
----

. Before the final step of creating the Virtual Application Network, let's go the https://skupper-network-observer-travel-db.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[Service Interconnect Network Console, window="network-console"] to visualize the the Virtual Application Network.

. Enter the username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}` if prompted.

. *Allow permissions* when this screen shows up.
+

. You should only be able to see the Openshift cluster (travel-db namespace). This is because the RHEL on-prem machine is not yet part of the Virtual Application Network.
