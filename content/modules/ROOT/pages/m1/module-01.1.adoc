== Activity: Set up {rhsi} on OpenShift
{m1}

You can set up Virtual Application Networks with {rhsi} by either using the command line interface or the OpenShift operator. 

In this exercise, we'll use the operator on the OpenShift cluster and the command line interface on the RHEL side just to explore both options. You could also use automation tools such as Ansible to automate the creation of the Virtual Application Network on both sides.



== Verify database access from Travels Service

. As a first step, verify whether the `travels` services has connectivity to the database. You will use the integrated terminal on the right to perform these checks as guided.

. In the *upper terminal*, log in to the OpenShift cluster using the command below. Click the clipboard icon image:common/clipboard.png[width=30px] to copy.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc login -u admin -p {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password} https://172.30.0.1:443
----

+
Type `y` when you are prompted with `Use insecure connections? (y/n)`. +
You should see a `Login successful` message

. From the *OpenShift Terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following command to check if the `travels` service and all other services (cars, discounts etc) are able to access the on-prem database.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl travels.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/Prague && echo
----

. You will receive a response `{"error":"Travel Quote for Prague not found"}` indicating that the database is not accessible, and the service is unable to get a travel quote for Prague. 

== Set up a {rhsi} Site

You will set up a Virtual Application Network using {rhsi} in the subsequent steps to help the core services (on OpenShift) access the on-premises database.

. Navigate to the {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[OpenShift Console, window="console"], and log in with username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}`

. Navigate to Home -> Projects -> travel-db, if you are not already in the `travel-db` project.
+
image::m1/projects_tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
. From the `travel-db` project, click on the *Service Interconnect tab* or click on this  {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[link, window="console"] to navigate directly.
. Click on *Create site*.

[.concept]
.What is a site?
****
A site represents a place where you have real running workloads. Each site contains an application service router which helps its workloads connect with workloads in remote sites. Ex: A namespace is a site
****
. In the *Create site* wizard, keep the default values. 
.. Note that the *Enable link access* is checked, indicating that this site will allow ingress connections from other sites. 
.. Click on *Submit* to set up the VAN routers in the `travel-db` namespace. 
+
image::m1/create_site.png[]
+
[.concept]
.What is a router?
****
Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN. However, instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7 application routers route messages between application endpoints (called Layer 7 application addresses).
****


. You will see a message indicating that the *Service Interconnect site* is being created. In a few seconds, the warning message will disappear, and the site will be created.
+
image::m1/site_create_warning.png[]

. The warning message disappears once the site is created.
+
image::m1/site_created.png[]
+
You will also notice a `Ready` status displayed in the *Details* tab, confirming that the site is ready.

== Set up a {rhsi} Listener

[.concept]
.What is a Listener?
****
A listener creates a local connection point that links to connectors in remote sites using routing keys. On Kubernetes, it's implemented as a Service; on Docker, Podman, and Linux, it's a listening socket on a local network interface. The listener exposes a host/port for local clients while using the routing key to connect with remote sites.
****

. Click on {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[Create listener, window="console"]  to set up a listener in the `travel-db` namespace.
+
image::m1/listener_button.png[]

. Input the following details and click *Submit*
** *Name*: `mysqldb`
** *Port*: `3306`
** *Routing key*: `appconn`
** *Host*: `mysqldb`
** *TLS secret*: leave this blank for now, as you will instead create a token at a later step.

== Set up an Access Token

[.concept]
.What is an Access Token?
****
An access token is a short-lived credential for creating a link between sites. It contains a URL and secret code from an access grant. Tokens have limited validity - by default, they can be used only once and expire after 15 minutes. 
****
.What is an Access Grant?
****
A site wishing to accept a link (site 1) creates an access grant.
It uses the access grant to issue a corresponding access token and transfers it to a remote site (site 2).
Site 2 submits the access token to site 1 for redemption.
If the token is valid, site 1 sends site 2 the TLS host, port, and credentials required to create a link to site 1
****
This image explains this concept in more detail.

image::m1/token_redemption.png[]

. Click on {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[Generate a token, window="console"].
+
image::m1/token_button.png[]

. You are presented with the *Issue Access Token* wizard. In the *Configuration* step, enter the following values, and click the *Create* button.
** *FileName*: `my-grant`
** *Redemptions*: `1`
** *Code*: leave this blank
** *Valid for*: `60` minutes
+
image:m1/create-access-token.png[] 
. You will be presented with the *Create token - How to* step. 
.. You can ignore the rest of the steps since you will use a script to directly convert the grant and transfer it to the on-premises RHEL server without the need for downloading the file.
.. If you would like to inspect how the token looks, you can still proceed to download and open the file. 
.. Click on *Done*. 
+
image::m1/token_done_screen.png[]

. From the *OpenShift Terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following command to deploy the ** {rhsi} Network Console**. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/scripts/refs/heads/main/m1/network_console_deploy.yaml -n travel-db
----
+
You will use this console to visualize the network later. Since it takes a few seconds to initialize, go ahead and deploy it now. While it is getting deployed, proceed to the next steps to save time.
