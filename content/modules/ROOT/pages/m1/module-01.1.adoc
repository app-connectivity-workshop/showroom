== Activity: Setting up the site on OpenShift
You can setup Virtual Application Networks with Red Hat Service Interconnect by either using the command line interface or the Openshift operator. In this exercise we'll use the operator on the OpenShift cluster and the command line interface on the RHEL side to explore both options. 

. First lets try to access our travels service and see if all our microservices have access to the database. We'll use the inbuilt terminal to the right of your screen. 


. In the *first terminal (upper terminal)*, login into the OpenShift cluster using the below command.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc login -u admin -p {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password} https://172.30.0.1:443
----

. Type `y` when your are prompted with *Use insecure connections? (y/n):*

. You should see a `Login successful.` message

. From the *Openshift Terminal (upper terminal)*, Run the following to check if the travels services and all other services are able to access the on-prem database.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl travels.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/Prague
----

. You will get a *{"error":"Travel Quote for Prague not found"}* message indicating that the database is not accessible. Let's set up the Virtual Application Network using Red Hat Service Interconnect in the subsequent steps that help our services access the database on-premises.

. Navigate to the {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[OpenShift Console, window="console"] and Login as username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}`

. Navigate to Home -> Projects -> travel-db and click on the Service Interconnect tab or click on this  {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[link, window="console"] to navigate directly.

. Click on *Create site*.  
+

. Leave the default values and click on Submit. This sets up the VAN routers in the `travel-db` namespace. The *Enable link access* is checked, indicating that this site will allow ingress connections from other sites.

[.concept]
.What is a site?
****
A site represents a particular location and a particular platform. It's a place where you have real running workloads. Each site contains an application service router to communicate with local workloads and forward to peers in remote sites.
****
+
[.concept]
.What is a router?
****
Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN. However, instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7 application routers route messages between application endpoints (called Layer 7 application addresses).
****


. You might see a message similar to the one shown below. This indicates that the Service Interconnect routers are being created. Wait a few seconds for the warning message to disappearÂ and the site to be created.
+
image::m1/site_create_warning.png[]

. Once the site is created, you should see screen as shown in the image below, without the warning message.
+
image::m1/site_created.png[]

. Once the site creation is complete. Click on the *Deploy Network Console* button to visualize the network later. This will take a few seconds to load. Proceed to the next steps while this gets deployed.
+

. Before we proceed, let us learn what a listener is.
+
[.concept]
.What is a Listener?
****
A listener binds a local connection endpoint to connectors in remote sites. Listeners and connectors are matched using routing keys. Each listener has an associated connection endpoint and routing key. The connection endpoint exposes a host and port for accepting connections from local clients. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the listener to connectors in remote sites. On Kubernetes, a listener is implemented as a Service. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, it is a listening socket bound to a local network interface.
****

. Click on *Create listener*. This sets up the listeners in the namespace.
+

. Input the following details and Submit.Leave the *TLS secret* field blank for now as we'll instead create a token later:
** *Name*: `mysqldb`
** *Port*: `3306`
** *Routing key*: `appconn`
** *Host*: `mysqldb`
+

. Next, let us learn what a Access Token is and create one.
+
[.concept]
.What is a token?
****
An access token is a short-lived credential used to create the link. An access token contains the URL and secret code of a corresponding access grant. Access tokens are issued from access grants. A grant issues zero or more tokens. Tokens are redeemed for links.
Access tokens have limited redemptions and limited lifespans. By default, they can be redeemed only once, and they expire 15 minutes after being issued. You can set custom limits by configuring the access grant.
****

. Click on *Generate a token*
+
image::m1/token_button.png[]

. Input the following details and Click *Create*:
** *FileName*: `my-grant`
** *Redemptions*: `1`
** *Valid for*: `60 minutes`

. Click on *Done*. If you would like to inspect how the token looks like, feel free to download and open the file. Ignore the token creation steps and as we'll use a script to directly convert and transfer it to our RHEL machine on-premises.
