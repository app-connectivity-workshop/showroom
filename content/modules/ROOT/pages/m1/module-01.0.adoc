== Module 1: Connect applications across on-prem and cloud with {rhsi}

{corp} is transitioning from a monolithic application to microservices using Red Hat OpenShift, while keeping their core database on-premises due to regulatory requirements. 

With OpenShift (microservices) and RHEL (database) running on different physical networks, they chose Red Hat Service Interconnect to create a secure Virtual Application Network (VAN) between these environments instead of implementing traditional VPNs which would require complex planning and management. Red Hat Service Interconnect enables connectivity through layer 7 addressing and routing by creating VANs between distributed services in minutes and securing all interconnections with mutual TLS (mTLS).

### Advantages of Layer 7 VAN over Traditional VPNs:

. VAN exposes only services, not entire network layers, requiring fewer firewall rules
. Traditional VPNs connect entire clusters, requiring extensive per-app firewall rules for isolation
. In a VAN, each site has its own Certificate Authority(CA), limiting security compromises
. Only exposed services can be accessed in a VAN, preventing unauthorized lateral movement in case of a breach

=== Activities overview:

. Set up the Service Interconnect routers on both OpenShift and RHEL

. Exchange a secure token created on the OpenShift cluster to the RHEL machine to establish a secure connection between the two machines.

. Set up  the microservices to use the listener (virtual endpoint) created by the Service Interconnect on the cluster to access remote database.
