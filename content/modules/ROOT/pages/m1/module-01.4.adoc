== Activity: Verify database access from services
{m1}

You are now ready to  verify if the travels services is now able to access the database. As part of the workshop set up, the travels services have already been configured to connect to the {rhsi} Listener on OpenShift, which serves as a virtual endpoint for the actual on-premises database.

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following curl command again to get a travel quote for the city *Prague* to check if the services are able to access the on-prem database. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl travels.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/Prague | jq
----

. You should see a response with cars, hotels, flights, and insurances returned from the database indicating that the services are able to access the database.

== Optional: Explore Network Console

. Return to the https://skupper-network-observer-travel-db.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[Service Interconnect Network Console, window="network-console"] and refresh the browser tab. Verify that the RHEL server is now part of the Virtual Application Network.

. Feel free to check the different options in the Service Interconnect Network Console such as Services, Sites, Components, and Processes to get a better understanding of the Virtual Application Network and some traffic related analytics. 

== Next steps for {corp}
If and when {corp} decides to add a database replica to a different environment or cluster, they can simply add it to the existing Virtual Application Network and link it to the same listener on OpenShift. Red Hat Service Interconnect will automatically handle failover and load balancing between the database instances.
