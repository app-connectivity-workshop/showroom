== Module 3: Simplify and secure traffic management with {rhcl}

== Activity: Developer workflow

In this section, you will perform the role of a developer and create a HTTPRoute, and apply the right policies.

== Test access to the Web Application

. The Web App has been deployed in OpenShift as part of the workshop setup.
. Access the Web App by clicking https://travels-blue-ui-travel-web.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[here^, console="access Web app"]
. You should see a 404. This is because the Travels core services endpoint hasn't been exposed using a HTTPRoute
+

== Set up HTTPRoute for Travels service endpoint

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new HTTPRoute.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *HTTPRoute* CR
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: travel-agency
  namespace: travel-agency
  labels:
    deployment: travels-v1
    service: travels
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: prod-web
      namespace: ingress-gateway
  hostnames:
    - api.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - group: ''
          kind: Service
          name: travels
          namespace: travel-agency
          port: 8000
          weight: 1
      matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
----

== Test Web App again after HTTPRoute is setup

. Refresh the Web application or access it from https://travels-blue-ui-travel-web.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[here^, console="access Web app"]. You should see a *403 - Forbidden* error
+
image:m3/partner-blue-403.png[] 

. This is because while you have the HTTPRoute now, the original deny-all default policy kicks in and doesn't allow any requests to made. We have a zero-trust auth in place!!

=== Setup Authpolicy

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new Authpolicy for the HTTPRoute.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following CRs which creates AuthPolicy along with the API Keys needed 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: travel-agency-authpolicy
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  defaults:
    rules:
      authentication:
        api-key-authn:
          apiKey:
            allNamespaces: false
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: partner
          credentials:
            queryString:
              name: APIKEY
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: travel-agency

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: apikey-blue
  namespace: kuadrant-system
  labels:
    authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino
    app: partner
stringData:
  api_key: blue
type: Opaque
----
. Click *Create* to create these resources
image:m3/auth-apikey-created.png[] 

== Test Web App again (after HTTPRoute and AuthPolicy are setup)

. Refresh the web application one more time. You should now see a API Call successful message
+
image:m3/webapp-success.png[] 
. Choose a City, a From and a To date, and click *Find details* button
+
image:m3/webapp-see-details.png[] 

===  Test the default RateLimit Policy
. Try clicking on the  *Find details* button the details more than 5 times.
. Expect to see a 429 error:
+
image:m3/partner-blue-429.png[]
. This is because of the super low rate limit configure for the Gateway.
. Since there is no RateLimit Policy for the Travels HTTPRoute, the Gateway's RateLimit Policy is applied to HTTPRoute as well.


=== Create a new RateLimit Policy which overrides default gateway policy

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new Authpolicy for the HTTPRoute.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following CRs which creates AuthPolicy along with the API Keys needed 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: ratelimit-policy-travels
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: travel-agency
  limits:
    "per-user":
      rates:
        - limit: 20
          window: 10s
      counters:
        - expression: auth.identity.userid
----
. Click *Create*.
image:m3/httproute-rlp-created.png[] 


== Test again (after HTTPRoute, AuthPolicy and RateLimitPolicy are setup)

. Try accessing the details again by clicking on the *Find details* button
+
image:m3/webapp-see-details.png[] 
. You should now be able retrieve details without a `429 - Too Many Requests` error for up to 20 requests in a duration of 10 seconds.

== Cleanup the Echo HTTPRoute

. Navigate to {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/kuadrant/overview[Connectivity Link Menu^, window="console"].
. Click on the kebab menu of the `echo-api` route, and click `Delete`
+
image:m3/delete-echo.png[] 
. Click on *Delete* button to confirm the deletion.
+
image:m3/delete-echo-confirm.png[] 

== A final note on Policies Override

. You would now notice that the `ingress-gateway-rlp-lowlimits` and `prod-web-deny-all` are showing up as `Accepted (Not Enforced)`
+
image:m3/gw-final-policies.png[] 
. This is because, while these policies are Accepted, they are not enforced because they are overridden by the policies applied to the HTTPRoute.
+
NOTE: You were asked to delete the `echo-api` HTTPRoute to demonstrate how policy overriding works. Unless removed, the RateLimit and Auth policies of the Gateway will remain `Enforced` because `echo-api` continues to inherit them, as no specific policies have been applied to override the Gateway's policies.
. Click on the *Connectivity Link > Policy Topology* link and explore. Thi view visualizes the relationships and interactions between different resources within your cluster related to {rhcl} (Kuadrant), allowing you to explore connections between Gateways, HTTPRoutes and the Policies
+

== Summary

. In this section, you played the role of a Developer and created a HTTPRoute for the Web Application to access the Travels core services. You applied the right Auth and Rate Limit policies to the HTTPRoute there by customising this to your application needs in a self-service manner
. In the next section, you will be introduced the the observability and monitoring
