== Module 3: Simplify and secure traffic management with {rhcl}

== Business context

With their growing popularity, {corp} would like to add new channels to their existing, store-based e-commerce application. They are working towards launching their own web app which requires access to from the app to their core services.

All inward traffic from mobile app or external systems need to be secured and managed. {corp} also wants to protect the endpoints by easily applying rate limiting and specific levels of access based on accessing users.


== Technical considerations

To expose core functionalities to mobile apps and external partners, {corp} needs to 

* Allow controlled access to connect to the services
* Secure traffic with automatic TLS integration
* Protect the services with uniform, flexible and powerful policies

{corp} decides to embrace a policy-as-code approach. As Gartner points out https://www.gartner.com/document/3992070[Policy as code (PaC)^, window="content"] provides repeatable and automated policy-based management through which one can define security through code.

{rhcl} provides Kubernetes-native traffic management in multi-cluster environments. It leverages the power of the Kubernetes Gateway API and Envoy proxy to provide a unified, efficient approach to managing ingress traffic and related policies in multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. With {rhcl}, platform engineers and application developers can collaborate to connect, secure, and protect distributed services and applications. 

{rhcl} builds on the Gateway API, offering DNS management, TLS certificate lifecycle management, authentication, and rate limiting across all gateway instances in multi-cluster environments. These policies, along with included observability metrics, standardize ingress traffic management in both single- and multi-cluster setups.

=== Gateway API

Gateway API is the new standard for Ingress from Kubernetes community. It represents L4/L7 routing and traffic management through generic common core API resources which reflects the separation of responsibilities such as Platform Engineer or App Developers

There are two specific Custom Resources (CR) we are interested in

* A *Gateway* CR describes how traffic can be translated to Services within the cluster
* A *HTTPRoute* CR enables advanced routing capabilities for Ingress, and specifies routing behavior of HTTP requests from a Gateway listener to an API object, i.e. Service


=== {rhcl} policies

Here is a view on how {rhcl}'s Policy APIs are applied on the Request flow on Gateway API. Typically Platform engineers apply policies to the Gateway, and Developers apply policies to the HttpRoute.

image:m3/rhcl-policies.png[] 

. *DNS Policy* provides DNS management by managing the lifecycle of DNS records (in the DNS provider) to setup ingress connectivity using DNS to bring traffic to the Gateway.
. *TLS Policy* This policy can be attached to a Gateway which configures all HTTPS listeners in the Gateway with a certificate
. *Rate Limit Policy* is attached to Gateways and HTTPRoutes to provide rate limiting of requests
. *Auth Policy* is attached to Gateways and HTTPRoutes and enforces authentication & authorization rules.

With this approach 

* *Platform Engineers* have the right level of control, and  can deploy, manage, observe and protect services exposed via their gateways. They can confidently allow application developers to self-service knowing that endpoints are secured
* *Application developers*, through self-service, can refine policies to their specific needs in order to protect exposed endpoints, and focus on what is important for them - their applications and code.

== Solution 

. The access to core services (Travels) service endpoint needs to be secured and protected for connectivity from the Web App that is being built.
. The team adopts a Kubernetes native approach to application connectivity through {rhcl}.
. Platform Engineers setup a Gateway which will allow for secure connection to the backend service endpoints. 
. Developers the onboarding their service endpoints by creating a HTTPRoute representing the endpoint. 
. Auth and RateLimit policies defaults are setup by Platform Engineers as a way to ensure zero-trust policy to suit their specific authz/authn needs and non-functional requirements for rate limiting. Of course, these will need to be overridden by the developers to allow controlled access to the services.

=== Environment Setup

As part of this workshop, certain components have been preconfigured in advance to ensure the module can be completed within a short timeframe.

. The Mobile Gateway service has been predeployed on your OpenShift cluster
. A hosted zone has been added as a subdomain, travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}, on AWS Route 53 for the applications that you want to manage and secure with {rhcl}. 
+
NOTE: In this case, the applications and services are running on AWS on an OpenShift cluster. And we leverage AWS Route 53 for DNS purposes. {rhcl} supports other DNS providers such as Azure, Google Cloud, and support for Core DNS is coming soon.
. As part of the activities, you will configure the necessary DNS policy to manage this subdomain with a Gateway (from Gateway API), ensuring the traffic can properly secured and managed. You will also setup {rhcl} CRs (custom resources) needed to connect, secure and manage the Mobile Gateway service.
