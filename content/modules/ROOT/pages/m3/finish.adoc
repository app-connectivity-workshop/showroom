== Congratulations on completing this module!

Congratulations! You have successfully learnt how to simplify and secure traffic management with {rhcl}.

You explored how *{rhcl}* through rich policy APIs can help you to manage and secure _north-south_[.red]^*^ traffic flow and secure access to core services from third-party applications.

With this set up, {corp} is all set to onboard further service endpoints to be accessed securely. This solution can be further extended to span across a multi-cluster setup, too.
