== Dynamic Plugin

Connectivity Link provides a Dynamic plugin to help you view the relevant resources from a single pane of glass.

Enable this plugin as guided in this interactive demo

Here the (AP) prod-web-deny-all is marked as Accepted (Not Enforced), because this AuthPolicy is accepted, but is overridden by the other policies (AP) echo-api-allow-all and (AP) globex-mobile-gateway

Explore the policies from one single place.

The Policy Topology view visualizes the relationships and interactions between different resources within your cluster related to Kuadrant, allowing you to explore connections between Gateways, HTTPRoutes and Kuadrant Policies.
