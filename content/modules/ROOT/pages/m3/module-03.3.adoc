. For the sake of this workshop, let us create some traffic to the `echo-api`. Run the following command on the *upper* terminal. You will see a combination of 403 and 429 errors in the terminal.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://echo.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}; done
----
. Access the Grafana dashboard tab again, and click the refresh button as shown in the screenshot below. 
+
You may need to refresh a couple of times for the metrics to appear in the Grafana dashboard.
+
Notice that 429 and 403 requests, as well as the total requests, are available in the different sections of the dashboard.
