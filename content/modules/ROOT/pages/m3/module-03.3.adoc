. For the sake of this workshop, let us create some traffic to the `echo-api`. Run the following command on the *upper* terminal. You will see a combination of 403 and 429 errors in the terminal.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://echo.travels.{ocp_cluster_workshop_main_domain}; done
----
. Access the Grafana dashboard tab again, and click the refresh button as shown in the screenshot below. 
+
You may need to refresh a couple of times for the metrics to appear in the Grafana dashboard.
+
Notice that 429 and 403 requests, as well as the total requests, are available in the different sections of the dashboard.

Don't see the HTTPRoute's policies? You might need to restart the kube-state-metrics pod. 

* Run this command in the top-right terminal to nudge the metrics a bit.

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rollout restart deployment/kube-state-metrics-kuadrant -n monitoring

* Refresh the dashboard using the image:m3/refresh.png[width=30px] button on top-right of the brwoser, and voila, everything is alright in our dashboard world.
