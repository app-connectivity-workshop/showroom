image:intro/travelzcorp.png[width=50%] 

In this workshop we will follow the story of *{corp}*, a global travel services company that is modernizing its application infrastructure. {corp} has started migrating its applications to the cloud but faces several hybrid cloud connectivity challenges:

. Connect cloud-based services to an on-premises database securely during the transition phase
. Enable fine-grained access control over service-to-service traffic within the distributed applications
. Secure external access to core services from third-party partner portals

Throughout this workshop, you will play the role of a platform engineer at {corp} and work through these challenges using Red Hat's connectivity solutions.

== Workshop Modules

This workshop is divided into 3 logical sections which provide a guided walkthrough shadowing {corp}'s journey

* *Module 1*: Connect applications across on-prem and cloud with *{rhsi}*. +
{rhsi} allows applications and services to communicate with each other regardless of the environment or platform
* *Module 2*: Secure microservices access control with *{rhossm}*. +
{rhossm} offers a uniform way to connect, manage, observe, and provide security for microservices-based applications.
* *Module 3:* Simplify and secure traffic management with *{rhcl}*. +
{rhcl} you manage your applications to connect and communicate across different cloud environments.
