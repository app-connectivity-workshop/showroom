== The story behind this workshop

image:intro/travelzcorp.png[width=50%] 

In this workshop we will follow the story of *{corp}*, a global travel services company that is modernizing its application infrastructure. As part of this transformation, {corp} has  begun migrating applications to the cloud. 

However, the company is encountering several challenges typical of a hybrid cloud environment:

* *Secure connectivity between cloud and on-premises systems*: During the transition, some critical databases remain on-premises. {corp} needs to securely connect its new cloud-based services to these legacy systems without exposing sensitive data.
* *Granular access control in a distributed environment*: With services now spread across multiple environments, controlling who can access what—and under which conditions—is increasingly complex. The company requires fine-grained, policy-driven service-to-service access controls.
* *Secure external access for users and partners*: Core services must be accessible to trusted third-party partners. {corp} needs to expose these services securely, while protecting them from unauthorized access or misuse.

Throughout this workshop, you will play the role of a platform engineer at {corp} and work through these challenges using Red Hat's connectivity solutions.

== Workshop Modules

This workshop is divided into 3 logical sections which provide a guided walkthrough shadowing {corp}'s journey

* *Module 1*: Connect applications across on-prem and cloud with *{rhsi}*. +
{rhsi} allows applications and services to communicate with each other regardless of the environment or platform
* *Module 2*: Secure microservices access control with *{rhossm}*. +
{rhossm} offers a uniform way to connect, manage, observe, and provide security for microservices-based applications.
* *Module 3:* Simplify and secure traffic management with *{rhcl}*. +
{rhcl} you manage your applications to connect and communicate across different cloud environments.
