== The story behind this workshop

image:intro/travelzcorp.png[width=70%] 

In this workshop we will follow the story of *{corp}*, a fictitious global travel services company that is modernizing its application infrastructure. As part of this transformation, {corp} has begun migrating applications to the cloud. 


==  Architecture overview
Here is a high-level view of the {corp} application architecture. 


image::intro/hl-arch.png[] 

* The {corp} web portal and core services have been migrated and deployed on OpenShift, while the database remains on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 
* The core services of {corp} are present in the `travel-agency` namespace. 
** The `hotels`, `cars`, `flights` and `insurances` services connect with the `travel-db` for the data, and gets the offers to be applied from the `discounts` service
** The `travels` service serves as the REST API to the web portal

The team is currently working towards establishing the necessary connectivity between the applications. 

However, they faces several challenges typical of a hybrid cloud environment:

* *Secure connectivity between cloud and on-premises systems*: During the transition, some critical databases remain on-premises. {corp} needs to securely connect its new cloud-based services to the on-premises dayabase without exposing sensitive data.
* *Granular access control in a distributed environment*: With a distributed micoservices architecture, controlling who can access what, and under which conditions, is increasingly complex. The company requires fine-grained, policy-driven service-to-service access controls.
* *Secure access for third-party partners*: Core services must be accessible to trusted third-party partners. {corp} needs to expose these services securely, while protecting them from unauthorized access or misuse.

Throughout this workshop, you will play the role of a platform engineer at {corp}, and occasionally that of a developer, and work through these challenges using Red Hat's connectivity solutions.

== Workshop Modules

This workshop is divided into 3 logical sections which provide a guided walkthrough shadowing {corp}'s journey

* *Module 1*: Explore how *{rhsi}* allows the core services on OpenShift to communicate with the on-prem database (on RHEL) seamlessly thereby enabling app connectivity across on-prem and cloud.

* *Module 2*: Learn how to manage microservices with *{rhossm}* through fine-grained access control between services, _east-west_[.red]^*^ traffic management, complex deployment strategies and observability.

* *Module 3:* Learn how *{rhcl}* through rich policy APIs  helps you to manage and secure _north-south_[.red]^*^ traffic flow and  secure access to core services from third-party partners.

TIP: [.red]^*^ In application connectivity, _east-west_ traffic refers to data flow between internal components/microservices, and  _north-south_ traffic refers to data flow between internal systems and external clients.

// * *Module 1* is mandatory and must be completed first.
// * You can then choose to proceed with *Module 2* or *Module 3* based on your interest.
// * If time permits, you may complete the remaining module as well.

== Workshop environment

This is a fully guided workshop. All necessary links, credentials, access details, and configurations are provided exactly when and where they are needed. No prior setup is required (ãƒ„)

* You will be working on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster deployed on AWS. 
* The workshop activities are performed using the OpenShift console and the integrated terminals on the right-hand side.
* You can adjust the width of this instructions and the right-side terminals windows with the resize grab handle as needed.
* Several components have been preconfigured to ensure this workshop can be completed within a short timeframe. Each of these components will be explained as you progress through the workshop.

NOTE: The *{corp}* application used in this workshop is based on the https://kiali.io/docs/tutorials/travels/[Kiali Travel Demo Tutorial^]
