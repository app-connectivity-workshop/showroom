== Module 2: Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}

== Activity: Implementing Least Privilege with Authorization Policies

In a typical microservices environment, especially within a service mesh like {rhossm}, it's common for services in the same namespace to communicate freely. While this simplifies development early on, it doesn't align with security best practices, especially when some services handle sensitive logic or customer data.

In this activity, you'll work with the `travel-agency` application, a demo travel booking platform comprising several interconnected microservices. One of these services—`discounts`—is responsible for calculating and applying pricing discounts based on proprietary business rules. Access to this service must be tightly controlled.

Currently, any service in the `travel-agency` namespace, including frontend aggregators like `travels`, can communicate with the `discounts` service. However, only specific backend services—`cars`, `flights`, `hotels`, and `insurances`- should be allowed to call `discounts`.

In this lab, you'll apply an `AuthorizationPolicy` to restrict access to the `discounts` service, enforcing a least privilege model. This will help you gain hands-on experience with Istio authorization policies in {rhossm} and reinforce important concepts around microservice security and service-to-service communication control.

== Calling the *discounts* service directly from the *travels* service

At this point in the module, you are able to call the `discounts` service directly from `travels`. 

To test this, run the following command in a terminal window:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=travels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-travels
----

Output
```
{"user":"hello-from-travels","discount":0.05}
```

This command calls the `discounts` services directly from the `travels` pod. 

Once you've run this command, you can visualize it in the Kiali Traffic.

[NOTE]
====
You may need to adjust the time in the Kiali graph from *Last 1m* to a larger window of time so see the traffic from the above command to replay and view the direct call from `travels` to `discounts` or wait a few minutes for the above `curl` command to show up in the Traffic Graph.
====

We can see traffic from the other services, but you can test connectivity directly from them as well by running the commands from the terminal:

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=flights -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-flights

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=insurances -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-insurances

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=cars -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-cars

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=hotels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-hotels
----

Output:
```
{"user":"hello-from-flights","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-insurances","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-cars","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-hotels","discount":0.05}
```

What we want to accomplish is to continue to allow these services to access `discounts` while preventing `travels` from accessing `discounts`. We can do this with the {rhossm} Custom Resource (CR) `AuthorizationPolicy`

== Configure and Apply an *AuthorizationPolicy* 

To configure an authorization policy, you create an `AuthorizationPolicy` custom resource. An authorization policy includes a selector, an action, and a list of rules:

* The `selector` field specifies the target of the policy
* The `action` field specifies whether to allow or deny the request
* The `rules` specify when to trigger the action
** The `from` field in the `rules` specifies the sources of the request
** The `to` field in the `rules` specifies the operations of the request
** The `when` field specifies the conditions needed to apply the rule

== Apply the *AuthorizationPolicy* 

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *AuthorizationPolicy* CR.

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-only-trusted-services
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: discounts
      version: v1
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals:
        - cluster.local/ns/travel-agency/sa/discount-access-sa
----

. Click the *Create* button to enforce the `AuthorizationPolicy` `allow-only-trusted-services`

Let's break down the above AuthorizationPolicy` `allow-only-trusted-services`

* `selector`: This targets the specific workload the policy applies to. In this case, it applies to any pod with `app=discounts` and `version=v1`.

* `action`: This tells Istio what to do when the rule matches. Since Istio's default behavior is to deny if no policy allows it, this rule allows specific traffic while denying everything else.

* `rules.from.source.principals`: This defines who can access the service. In this case, only workloads running in the `travel-agency` namespace using the service account named `discount-access-sa` are permitted to make requests to the discounts service.

[NOTE]
====
For this hands-on lab, the `discount-access-sa` service account has already been created for you and added to the backend services (`cars`, `flights`, `hotels`, `insurances`).
====

== Test the *AuthorizationPolicy*  `allow-only-trusted-services`

Now that you have applied the AuthorizationPolicy `allow-only-trusted-services`, let's test to make sure the right services within the `travel-agency` namespace have the correct access to the `discounts` service by running the following commands in the terminal:

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=flights -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-flights

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=insurances -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-insurances

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=cars -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-cars

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=hotels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-hotels

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=travels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-travels

echo 
----


Output:
```
{"user":"hello-from-flights","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-insurances","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-cars","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-hotels","discount":0.05}
RBAC: access denied
```

After applying the `AuthorizationPolicy` that only allows requests to the `discounts` service from workloads using the `discount-access-sa` service account, we can verify that it's working as expected by testing access from a service that should not be allowed, like `travels`.

Run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=travels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-travels

echo
----

You can no longer access `discounts` and instead get the response:

```
RBAC: access denied
```

[NOTE]
====
You can view the above `RBAC: access denied` call in the Kiali Traffic Graph as well. It will appear in red as a status `403` HTTP return code.
====

*What's Happening?*

* The `AuthorizationPolicy` applied to the `discounts` service is doing its job:
It is only allowing traffic from workloads using the `discount-access-sa` service account.

* The `travels` service is not using that service account, so Istio denies the request.

* Istio's Envoy proxy generates the message `RBAC: access denied`, enforcing the policy at the network layer.

This confirms that unauthorized services are blocked from reaching `discounts`, enforcing the least privilege model we set out to implement. It's a strong validation that the service mesh is securing traffic as expected.


== Summary: Implementing Least Privilege with Authorization Policies

In this section, you applied your first `AuthorizationPolicy` in {rhossm} to secure service-to-service communication within the `travel-agency` namespace.

You learned that services within the same namespace can communicate freely by default—this includes services like `travels`, which should not have access to the sensitive `discounts` service.

To align with the principle of *least privilege*, you:

* Identified that only backend services (`cars`, `flights`, `hotels`, and `insurances`) should have access to `discounts`
* Created an `AuthorizationPolicy` that explicitly allows only workloads using the `discount-access-sa` service account to communicate with `discounts`
* Verified access using real traffic and saw:
** ✅ Allowed access for trusted services
** ❌ Denied access from unauthorized services like `travels`

This hands-on activity demonstrated how Istio and OpenShift Service Mesh allow you to enforce fine-grained access control using a simple, declarative policy model. This helps you improve security posture and reduce the blast radius of potential service compromise.

== Next steps

In the next section we will leverage {rhossm} to shape and manage traffic flows using techniques like canary rollouts, mirroring, and weighted routing to safely introduce new service versions.
