== Activity: Implement Least Privilege with Authorization Policies

{m2}

As it stands, the microservices in the `travel-agency` namespace can currently communicate freely. While this makes the development cycle easier, it poses security risks especially for services like `discounts` which applies proprietary pricing logic and handles sensitive data.

In this section, you'll apply an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy` to enforce a least privilege model, allowing access to `discounts` only from the allowed backend services (`hotels`, `cars`, `flights` and `insurance` services), and not from the `travels` REST API.


== Review current access of *discounts* service

. Run the following command in the *upper terminal* to verify that you are indeed able to access the `discounts` service directly from all the services in the `travel-agency` name space. +
This command calls the `discounts` service directly from the  pods of the services. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=travels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-travels

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=flights -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-flights

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=insurances -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-insurances

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=cars -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-cars

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=hotels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-hotels
----
. The output verifies access of `discounts` service directly from `travels` REST API, and other services such as `cars` and `hotels`.
+
```
{"user":"hello-from-travels","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-flights","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-insurances","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-cars","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-hotels","discount":0.05}
```

== Restrict access to `discounts` service 

Your goal is to restrict access to the `discounts` service so that only specific backend services can access it, while preventing access from the `travels` REST API. This is achieved using an Istio Custom Resource (CR) `AuthorizationPolicy`.

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource. Log in with username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}` if prompted.
+

. In the YAML editor, copy the following *AuthorizationPolicy* CR, and click *Create*.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-only-trusted-services
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: discounts
      version: v1
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals:
        - cluster.local/ns/travel-agency/sa/discount-access-sa
----
+
[NOTE]
====
A brief description of the above `AuthorizationPolicy`

* the *selector* specifies the workload which is the `discounts` service in this case
* the *action* ALLOWs traffic based on the rules set
* the *rules* allows requests from workloads using the service account named `discount-access-sa`

The `discount-access-sa` service account has already been created and added to the allowed backend services as part of the workshop set up.
====


== Test the *AuthorizationPolicy* 

. Run the following command in the *upper terminal* to ensure the `travels` REST API is no longer able to access the `discounts` service.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=travels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-travels && echo
----
. You should no longer be able to access `discounts` service but instead get an `access denied` response.
+
```
RBAC: access denied
```
+
WARNING: It may take a few seconds for the AuthorizationPolicy to take effect. Please retry if you still see a success response. 

. Verify that the allowed services can still access the `discounts` service by running the following command in the *upper terminal*.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=flights -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-flights

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=insurances -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-insurances

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=cars -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-cars

oc rsh -n travel-agency $(oc get pod -l app=hotels -n travel-agency -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  curl http://discounts.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/discounts/hello-from-hotels
----
+
Output:
+
```
{"user":"hello-from-flights","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-insurances","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-cars","discount":0.05}
{"user":"hello-from-hotels","discount":0.05}
```

== Summary: 

In this section, you applied an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`  to secure service-to-service communication within the `travel-agency` namespace to demonstrate how {rhossm} allows you to enforce fine-grained access control using a simple, declarative policy model. 

== Next steps

In the next section you will leverage {rhossm} to shape and manage traffic flows using techniques like canary rollouts to safely introduce new service versions.
