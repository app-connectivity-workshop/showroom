== Activity: Exploring Service Mesh with Kiali

== Exploring Observability with Kiali

With sidecars injected, open (or reopen) the Kiali console:

Navigate to the Kiali console in a new tab:

* http://kiali-istio-system.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Link to Kiali console] 

Now let's explore the Kiali navigation tabs in the left menu.

=== Traffic Graph

From the left menu, select the *Traffic Graph* tab as shown in the following screen shot

Choose above the highlighted sections to match:

* Select `Namespace: travel-agency`
* Select `Versioned App Graph`
* Set auto-refresh to `Every 10s`.

In the upper *display* menu, ensure the following check boxes have been selected:

* `Traffic Distribution` 
* `Traffic Animation` (for a dynamic view)

Feel free to experiment with some of the other display options to view real-time metrics of the `travel-agency` application.

The *Traffic Graph* shows service interactions, request rates, and HTTP status codes.

[NOTE]
====
Since Kiali is showing metrics collected in the past, and we just enabled sidecar-injection, it may take a minute or two for the dragram to come up-to-date.

This graph helps us to identify those services that could have some problems. In our example everything is green and healthy!

Let's take a look at some of the other navigation tabs in the left menu.

=== Workloads

image:m2/kiali-workloads-travel.png[]

Select a workload like `travels-v1`. Review the following upper-menu tabs:

 - Overview
 - Traffic
 - Logs
 - Inbound Metrics
 - Outbound Metrics
 - Envoy

==== Overview tab
The Overview tab under Workloads in Kiali gives a high-level summary of the selected workload, including its health status, traffic metrics, associated services, and configuration details. It helps you quickly assess how a workload is performing and interacting within the mesh.

==== Traffic tab

The Traffic tab under Workloads in Kiali visualizes inbound and outbound traffic for the selected workload, showing real-time request rates, response codes, and latencies. It helps you understand how the workload communicates with other services and identify potential bottlenecks or failures.

==== Logs tab
The Logs tab in Kiali provides real-time access to logs for individual workloads within the service mesh, making it easy to troubleshoot and analyze traffic behavior. You can filter logs by container, time range, and even correlate them with traces and metrics for deeper insight.

==== Inbound Metrics tab

The Inbound Metrics tab under Workloads in Kiali displays detailed telemetry for incoming traffic to the selected workload, including request rates, response times, and error rates. It helps you monitor how the workload is being accessed and assess its performance and reliability.

Feel free to explore *Outbound Metrics*, *Envoy*, *Services*, *Istio Config*, and *Mesh* tabs as well.

=== Summary:

Congratulations! You’ve enabled automatic sidecar injection, onboarded an application into the mesh, and used Kiali to visualize and analyze service traffic.

== Next steps

In the next section, you’ll implement an `AuthorizationPolicy` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in {rhossm} to explicitly control which services can talk to each other. This enforces a least-privilege model for east-west service communication.
