== Activity: Explore Service Mesh with Kiali
{m2}

Kiali offers a number of ways to examine the micoservices which are managed by {rhossm}. This helps users to quickly evaluate the health of their service architecture.

In this module we will explore just a few ways to explore the real-time metrics.

== Explore Traffic Graph

. Click http://kiali-istio-system.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/console/graphpf/namespaces/?graphType=versionedApp&namespaces=travel-agency&duration=60&refresh=10000&layout=kiali-dagre&edges=trafficDistribution&animation=true[Kiali's Traffic Graph, window="kiali"] to view the details of the `travel-agency` namespace. 
+
Some parameters have been preset in this link for easier access. Refresh rate is set at `10s`, and Traffic Distribution and Traffic Animation (for a dynamic view) options have been turned ON.

. The *Traffic Graph* shows service interactions, request rates, and HTTP status codes. This graph helps us identify services that may have problems. In our example, everything is green and healthy!

+
NOTE: Since enabled sidecar injection just a while ago, it may take a minute or two for  the graph to show the updated metrics.

. You can zoom into the Kiali console to get a better view of `travel-agency` Traffic Graph.
+
NOTE: Wondering where all this traffic is coming from? As part of the workshop set up, a traffic simulator has also been deployed on OpenShift (｡◕‿◕｡) 

== Explore Workloads

. From Kiali Console, navigate to the http://kiali-istio-system.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/console/workloads?duration=60&refresh=10000&namespaces=travel-agency[Workloads] menu.
+

. Select the `travels-v1` workload to review the various metrics available.

. The *Overview tab* gives a high-level summary of the selected workload, including its health status and traffic metrics. It helps you quickly assess how a workload performs and interacts within the mesh.

. *Traffic tab* visualizes inbound and outbound traffic for the selected workload, showing real-time request rates, response codes, and latencies.

. *Inbound Metrics*  displays detailed telemetry for incoming traffic to the selected workload, including request rates, response times, and error rates.

. Feel free to explore *Logs*, *Outbound Metrics*, *Envoy*, *Services*, *Istio Config*, and *Mesh* tabs as well.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've enabled automatic sidecar injection, onboarded an application into the mesh, and used Kiali to visualize and analyze service traffic.

== Next steps

In the next section, you'll implement an `AuthorizationPolicy` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in {rhossm} to explicitly control which services can talk to each other. This enforces a least-privilege model for east-west service communication.
