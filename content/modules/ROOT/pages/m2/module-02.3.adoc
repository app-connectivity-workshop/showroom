== Module 2: Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}

== Shaping Traffic with OpenShift Service Mesh

In the previous section, you secured service-to-service communication using `AuthorizationPolicy` to enforce least privilege access.

Now that your services are locked down and secured, it's time to focus on how traffic flows between them.

In this next section, we'll leverage {rhossm} to **shape and manage traffic flows** using advanced techniques like:

* **Canary rollouts** – gradually introducing new versions of a service
* **Mirroring** – sending a copy of live traffic to a new version without impacting users
* **Weighted routing** – splitting traffic between service versions based on percentage

These patterns allow teams to roll out changes safely and with confidence—minimizing risk while gaining real-time observability and control.

Let's dive in!

== Why Progressive Delivery Matters

As a growing travel platform, the `travel-agency` team is continuously rolling out new features and improvements to core services like `discounts`, which directly impact pricing and promotions. Because these changes affect customer experience and revenue, it's crucial that updates are rolled out in a way that is safe, observable, and reversible.

=== Business Value

* Reduce risk of downtime or customer impact during deployments
* Roll out new discount strategies or A/B test pricing models gradually
* Gain real-time feedback on new features before going fully live
* Improve developer agility while maintaining high service reliability

By rolling out new versions to a small percentage of traffic first, the company can detect anomalies early, monitor KPIs, and react quickly—before a full-scale rollout.

=== Technical Value

* Use {rhossm} to manage traffic flow with fine-grained control
* Apply **weighted routing** between service versions with zero downtime
* Leverage observability tools like **Kiali**, **Distributed Tracing**, and **Prometheus** to monitor behavior
* Validate deployments in production without exposing all users to risk

Progressive delivery strategies like **canary deployments** are a foundational capability for DevOps and SRE teams looking to increase deployment frequency without sacrificing reliability.

In this activity, you'll implement these patterns using OpenShift Service Mesh.

== Activity: Gradual Traffic Shifting with Weighted Routing

image:m2/canary.png[width=600]

Now that you've secured your services, it's time to explore how {rhossm} can help you **safely roll out new versions** of a service without taking down your entire application or impacting every user.

In this activity, you'll simulate a real-world **canary deployment** strategy by introducing a new version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) and gradually shifting traffic to it.

This technique allows teams to:

* Test new features in production with real users
* Monitor performance, metrics, and errors before going fully live
* Roll back instantly if issues occur

.Canary Deployment
****
The idea behind a "canary deployment" (or "canary rollout") is to introduce a new version of a service by first testing it using a small percentage of user traffic, and then if all goes well, increase, possibly gradually in increments, the percentage while simultaneously phasing out the old version. If anything goes wrong along the way, we abort and roll back to the previous version. In its simplest form, the traffic sent to the canary version is a randomly selected percentage of requests, but in more sophisticated schemes it can be based on the region, user, or other properties of the request.
****

In the next steps, you will define the `DestinationRule` and `VirtualService` resources. These rely on the `version` label to identify and route traffic between service versions. Without this label, Istio cannot distinguish between different versions of the `discounts` service, and traffic shaping will not work as intended.


=== Step 1: Define Traffic Routing Rules

You'll define both a `DestinationRule` and a `VirtualService`:

* The `DestinationRule` defines two subsets: `v1` and `v2`
* The `VirtualService` initially sends 100% of traffic to `v1`, 0% to `v2`

=== Understanding DestinationRule and VirtualService

In OpenShift Service Mesh, the `DestinationRule` and `VirtualService` resources work together to control how traffic is routed between services. These are essential tools for managing traffic flow, enabling advanced deployment strategies like canary releases, blue/green deployments, and A/B testing.

[.concept]
.DestinationRule
****
A `DestinationRule` defines policies that are applied to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred. One of the primary use cases for a DestinationRule is to define *subsets* — logical versions of a service that can be targeted individually. These subsets are typically defined using labels that correspond to different versions of the service (for example, v1, v2, v3).
****

In our example, we define a `DestinationRule` for the `discounts` service with two subsets: `v1` and `v2

== Apply the *DestinationRule* 

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *DestinationRule* CR

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  host: discounts
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
----

In the above example, we define a `DestinationRule` for the `discounts` service with two subsets: `v1` and `v2`

This tells the service mesh that there are two distinct versions of the `discounts` service, identified by their `version` label.


[.concept]
.VirtualService
****
A `VirtualService` defines how requests are routed to a service. It lets us control the traffic distribution between different subsets defined in the corresponding `DestinationRule`.
****

== Apply the *VirtualService* 

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *VirtualService* CR

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  hosts:
    - discounts
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v1
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v2
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 0
----

Above is the VirtualService configuration for the `discounts` service.

This VirtualService currently routes *100% of traffic to version v1* of the `discounts` service. Although version v2 is defined as a valid subset, it is receiving 0% of the traffic at this time, as it has not yet been deployed.

Once the `v2` version is deployed to the `travel-agancy` namespace in OpenShift, we can modify the `VirtualService` to gradually shift traffic to it. This setup enables safe and controlled rollout of new service versions, making it easier to test and validate changes in a production-like environment.

=== Step 2: Deploy the `discounts-v2` Service

You'll deploy a second version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) into the mesh. It will run alongside the existing `v1` version but won't receive traffic until we configure routing.


. To deploy `discounts-v2` click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *Deployment* CR

[NOTE]
====
This version uses the same container image but sets environment variables to identify itself as `v2`.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `version: v2` label in the `discounts-v2` Deployment CRD is essential for enabling Istio's traffic routing.

This label allows:

* The `DestinationRule` to define a subset named `v2`
* The `VirtualService` to route a percentage of traffic specifically to version `v2`
* Fine-grained control for techniques like canary deployments, A/B testing, and blue-green rollouts
