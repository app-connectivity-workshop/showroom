=== Summary:

Congradulations on completing the "Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}" module!!!


In this module, we explored how {corp} can use {rhossm} to address the growing complexity of managing microservices. By adopting a consistent, code-free approach to observability, traffic control, and security, {corp} is better positioned to scale its applications while reducing operational risk.

Through hands-on activities, we:

* Configured core components of {rhossm} to gain visibility and control over service communication.

* Implemented a zero trust security model by applying an AuthorizationPolicy to restrict service access based on need.

* Used advanced traffic management techniques, such as canary rollouts, to safely deploy new service versions.

These capabilities empower {corp} to innovate faster, deploy with confidence, and maintain high standards of security and reliability across its application landscape.
