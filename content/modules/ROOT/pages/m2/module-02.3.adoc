== Activity: Shape Traffic with OpenShift Service Mesh
{m2}

Now that your services are locked down and secured, it's time to focus on how traffic flows between them.

As a growing travel platform, the {corp} team continuously rolls out new features and improvements to core services like `discounts`, which directly impact pricing and promotions. Because these changes affect customer experience and revenue, it's crucial that updates are rolled out in a safe, observable, and reversible way.

You will leverage {rhossm} to **shape and manage traffic flows** using advanced techniques like:

* **Canary rollouts** - gradually introducing new versions of a service
* **Mirroring** - sending a copy of live traffic to a new version without impacting users
* **Weighted routing** - splitting traffic between service versions based on percentage

These patterns allow teams to roll out changes safely and confidently, minimizing risk while gaining real-time observability and control.

== Activity: Gradual Traffic Shifting with Weighted Routing

In this activity, you'll simulate a real-world **canary deployment** strategy by introducing a new version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) and gradually shifting traffic to it.

NOTE: Canary deployment is a strategy where a new version (the canary) is tested before all of the old instances are replaced

You will define the `DestinationRule` and `VirtualService` resources which together to control how traffic is routed between services, and are essential tools for managing traffic flow, enabling advanced deployment strategies like canary releases, blue/green deployments, and A/B testing.

== Create a *DestinationRule* 

You will define a `DestinationRule` for the `discounts` service with two subsets: `v1` and `v2`

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.

image:common/create-yaml.png[]
. In the YAML editor, paste the following *DestinationRule* CR, and click the *Create* button.

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  host: discounts
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
----


== Apply the *VirtualService* 

You will next create a `VirtualService` that initially sends 100% of traffic to `v1`, 0% to `v2`

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *VirtualService* CR and click *Create*.

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  hosts:
    - discounts
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v1
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v2
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 0
----

. This VirtualService currently routes 100% of traffic to version *v1*, since *v2* is not yet deployed.

=== Step 2: Deploy the `discounts-v2` Service

You'll deploy a second version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) into the mesh. It will run alongside the existing `v1` version but won't receive traffic until we configure routing.

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *Deployment* CR and click *Create*.

. Wait for the deployment to scale to 1 pod successfully.

NOTE: The `version: v2` label in the `discounts-v2` Deployment CRD is essential for enabling Istio's traffic routing.
