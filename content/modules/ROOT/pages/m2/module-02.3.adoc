== Shaping Traffic with OpenShift Service Mesh

In the previous section, you secured service-to-service communication using `AuthorizationPolicy` to enforce least privilege access.

Now that your services are locked down and secured, it's time to focus on how traffic flows between them.

In this next section, we‚Äôll leverage {rhossm} to **shape and manage traffic flows** using advanced techniques like:

* **Canary rollouts** ‚Äì gradually introducing new versions of a service
* **Mirroring** ‚Äì sending a copy of live traffic to a new version without impacting users
* **Weighted routing** ‚Äì splitting traffic between service versions based on percentage

These patterns allow teams to roll out changes safely and with confidence‚Äîminimizing risk while gaining real-time observability and control.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

== üöÄ Why Progressive Delivery Matters

As a growing travel platform, the `travel-agency` team is continuously rolling out new features and improvements to core services like `discounts`, which directly impact pricing and promotions. Because these changes affect customer experience and revenue, it‚Äôs crucial that updates are rolled out in a way that is safe, observable, and reversible.

=== üìà Business Value

* Reduce risk of downtime or customer impact during deployments
* Roll out new discount strategies or A/B test pricing models gradually
* Gain real-time feedback on new features before going fully live
* Improve developer agility while maintaining high service reliability

By rolling out new versions to a small percentage of traffic first, the company can detect anomalies early, monitor KPIs, and react quickly‚Äîbefore a full-scale rollout.

=== üõ† Technical Value

* Use {rhossm} to manage traffic flow with fine-grained control
* Apply **weighted routing** between service versions with zero downtime
* Leverage observability tools like **Kiali**, **Distributed Tracing**, and **Prometheus** to monitor behavior
* Validate deployments in production without exposing all users to risk

Progressive delivery strategies like **canary deployments** are a foundational capability for DevOps and SRE teams looking to increase deployment frequency without sacrificing reliability.

In this activity, you'll implement these patterns using OpenShift Service Mesh.

== üö¶ Activity: Gradual Traffic Shifting with Weighted Routing

Now that you‚Äôve secured your services, it‚Äôs time to explore how {rhossm} can help you **safely roll out new versions** of a service without taking down your entire application or impacting every user.

In this activity, you‚Äôll simulate a real-world **canary deployment** strategy by introducing a new version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) and gradually shifting traffic to it.

This technique allows teams to:
* Test new features in production with real users
* Monitor performance, metrics, and errors before going fully live
* Roll back instantly if issues occur


In the next steps, you will define the `DestinationRule` and `VirtualService` resources. These rely on the `version` label to identify and route traffic between service versions. Without this label, Istio cannot distinguish between different versions of the `discounts` service, and traffic shaping will not work as intended.


=== üéØ Step 1: Define Traffic Routing Rules

You‚Äôll define both a `DestinationRule` and a `VirtualService`:

* The `DestinationRule` defines two subsets: `v1` and `v2`
* The `VirtualService` initially sends 100% of traffic to `v1`, 0% to `v2`

== Apply the *DestinationRule* 

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *DestinationRule* CR

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  host: discounts
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
----

== Apply the *VirtualService* 

. Click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *VirtualService* CR

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: discounts
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  hosts:
    - discounts
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v1
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: discounts
        subset: v2
        port:
          number: 8000
      weight: 0
----

=== üß™ Step 2: Deploy the `discounts-v2` Service

You‚Äôll deploy a second version of the `discounts` service (`v2`) into the mesh. It will run alongside the existing `v1` version but won‚Äôt receive traffic until we configure routing.


. To deploy `discounts-v2` click the *(+)* button on the top navigation bar of {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}[Openshift Console^, window="console"] to create a new resource.
. In the YAML editor, copy the following *Deployment* CR

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: discounts-v2
  namespace: travel-agency
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: discounts
      version: v2
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        readiness.status.sidecar.istio.io/applicationPorts: ""

            zipkin:
              address: zipkin.istio-system:9411
            sampling: 10
            custom_tags:
              http.header.portal:
                header:
                  name: portal
              http.header.device:

                  name: device
              http.header.user:

              http.header.travel:
                header:
                  name: travel
      labels:
        app: discounts
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: discounts
          image: quay.io/kiali/demo_travels_discounts:v1
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities:
              drop:
              - ALL
            privileged: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          env:
            - name: CURRENT_SERVICE
              value: "discounts"
            - name: CURRENT_VERSION
              value: "v2"
            - name: LISTEN_ADDRESS
              value: ":8000"
----

Wait for your deployment to sucessfully scale to 1 pod

image:m2/discounts-v2-deployment.png[]

[NOTE]
====
This version uses the same container image but sets environment variables to identify itself as `v2`.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `version: v2` label in the `discounts-v2` Deployment is essential for enabling Istio's traffic routing.

This label allows:

* The `DestinationRule` to define a subset named `v2`
* The `VirtualService` to route a percentage of traffic specifically to version `v2`
* Fine-grained control for techniques like canary deployments, A/B testing, and blue-green rollouts
====

=== Set Kiali Display Options

To ensure we can monitor the canary rollout, let's make sure we can observe the necessary display options in our Kiali Traffic Graph

To get the URL to the Kiali console, run:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
echo "http://$(oc get route kiali -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----

image:m2/kiali-display-options-pre-rollout.png[]

Make sure you have the following options set in the Kiali Traffic Graph:

*Top Menu*

1. Namespace: `travel-agency`
2. Replay `Last 1m` `Every 10s` - To display the most up-to-date data

*Display Options*

1. Traffic Distribution - To display traffic distribution between `v1` and `v2`
2. Idle Nodes - Will display our `v2` deployment
3. Traddic Animation - Informational traffic flow animation


=== üê¢ Step 3: Run a Canary Rollout Script

Now you‚Äôll run a simple Bash script to gradually shift traffic from `v1` to `v2` in stages: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and finally 100%. The script patches the `VirtualService` on the fly, and you‚Äôll observe the results in real time via Kiali, as well as from logs in the terminal window.

[NOTE]
====
In this lab, we are using a simple Bash script to perform a canary rollout for illustrative and educational purposes. This helps demonstrate how traffic shifting works in OpenShift Service Mesh in a straightforward, hands-on way.

In a real-world production environment, organizations typically use a progressive delivery tool like **Argo Rollouts**, which provides advanced deployment strategies such as canary, blue-green, and automated analysis. Argo Rollouts is included as part of **OpenShift Container Platform**.
====


* In the upper terminal, run the log monitoring script:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh ./canary-monitoring.sh
----

You should immediatly start seeing log output from discounts-v1 `[discounts/v1]` in green text.

image:m2/log-output-pre-rollout.png[]

* In the lower terminal, run the canary-rollout script:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh ./canary-rollout.sh
----

This will start updating the weights in the VirtualService every 20 seconds.

image:m2/log-output-50-50-rollout.png[]

Once the rollout begins, you will see logs in the upper terminal for discount-v2 `[discount/v2]` in yellow text gradually increase, while log messages from discount-v1 `[discount/v1]` decrease.

Expected final output:

```bash
Begin Canary Rollout in 20 seconds...
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
90% traffic routed to v1, 10% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
75% traffic routed to v1, 25% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
50% traffic routed to v1, 50% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
25% traffic routed to v1, 75% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
0% traffic routed to v1, 100% to v2
```

=== üëÄ Step 4: Observe in Kiali

As the script progresses, switch to the *Kiali console* and open the *Traffic Graph* for the `travel-agency` namespace.

TIP: Set the refresh rate to *10s* and the time window to *Last 1m* to clearly observe traffic shifting between service versions.

image:m2/canary-k-0.png[]

You‚Äôll begin to see more and more requests routed to the `discounts-v2` pod as the script progresses.

image:m2/canary-k-1.png[]

And finally

image:m2/canary-k-2.png[]

=== üßº Cleanup/Reset (Optional)

If you'd like to reset traffic routing back to 100% to `v1`, you can reapply the `VirtualService` manifest or run a patch manually.

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc -n travel-agency patch virtualservice discounts --type=json -p='[
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/http/0/route/0/weight", "value": 100},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/http/0/route/1/weight", "value": 0}
]'
----



=== Summary:

You‚Äôve just performed a progressive rollout of a new version of a microservice using weighted routing in OpenShift Service Mesh. This powerful technique enables you to test updates incrementally, observe behavior, and reduce the risk of pushing changes to production.
Congradulations on completing "Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}" !!!

=== End of Module Summary

In this module, we explored how {corp} can use {rhossm} to address the growing complexity of managing microservices. By adopting a consistent, code-free approach to observability, traffic control, and security, {corp} is better positioned to scale its applications while reducing operational risk.

Through hands-on activities, we:

* Configured core components of {rhossm} to gain visibility and control over service communication.

* Implemented a zero trust security model by applying an AuthorizationPolicy to restrict service access based on need.

* Used advanced traffic management techniques, such as canary rollouts, to safely deploy new service versions.

These capabilities empower {corp} to innovate faster, deploy with confidence, and maintain high standards of security and reliability across its application landscape.
