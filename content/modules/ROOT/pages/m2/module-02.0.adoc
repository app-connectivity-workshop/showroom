== Module 2: Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}

== Business context

* As {corp} expands its digital services, the move to a microservices-based architecture brings greater agility—but also increased complexity in managing how services communicate, scale, and stay secure. Without a consistent approach, deploying updates or ensuring service reliability becomes risky and resource-intensive.

* {rhossm} provides {corp} with a unified solution to manage, observe, and secure its microservices environment. It enables consistent traffic control, real-time visibility, and zero-trust security policies—all without requiring changes to the application code. With capabilities like canary deployments, {corp} can introduce new features more safely and confidently, accelerating delivery while minimizing disruption.

== Technical considerations

To successfully implement {rhossm}, there are a few key technical factors to consider:

* *Namespace and Workload Configuration*: Ensure workloads are deployed in namespaces configured for mesh participation, with sidecar injection enabled (either automatic or manual).

* *mTLS and Identity*: {rhossm} uses mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate and encrypt service-to-service traffic. Proper certificate management and identity policies are essential.

* *Authorization Policies*: Fine-grained access control can be implemented using AuthorizationPolicy CRDs to enforce least-privilege communication between services.

* *Traffic Management*: Canary deployments, traffic splitting, and fault injection require well-defined routing rules using VirtualServices and DestinationRules.

* *Observability Stack*: Tools like Kiali, Distributed Tracing, and Prometheus are included for service visualization, tracing, and metrics—ensure they are properly deployed and accessible.

These technical foundations will ensure {corp} can fully realize the benefits of {rhossm} in a production-ready environment.

=== Solution: 

=== Environment Setup

As part of this workshop, certain components have been preconfigured in advance to ensure the module can be completed within a short timeframe.

=== Activities overview:

. Understand and Configure OpenShift Service Mesh Components. Gain visibility and consistent control over service-to-service communication within your mesh-enabled applications.

. Enforce Fine-Grained Service Access Using Zero Trust Principles. Ensure only authorized services can interact with sensitive backends, reducing the attack surface and aligning with zero trust security practices.

. Manage Traffic for Progressive Delivery. Reduce deployment risk and improve reliability by gradually rolling out changes and validating behavior in production before full release.

== Next steps

In the next section we will explore the key components of {rhossm}—including the control plane, sidecar proxies, and observability tools. Configure namespaces and onboard workloads into the mesh using automatic or manual sidecar injection.
