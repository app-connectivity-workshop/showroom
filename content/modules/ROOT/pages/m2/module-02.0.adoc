== Module 2: Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}

{corp}'s move to a microservices-based architecture brings greater agility, but also results in increased complexity in managing how the microservices communicate with each other and stay secure. 

{corp} wants apply access policies to the interaction between microservices, enable deployment strategies such as Canary Deployment, and  monitor the microservices applications.

NOTE: Canary deployment is a strategy where a new version (the canary) is tested before all of the old instances are replaced


{rhossm} based on the open source https://istio.io/[Istio project^],  provides {corp} a uniform way to connect, manage, observe, and provide security for their microservices-based applications. It also includes behavioral insight (observability) into the networked microservices which are onboarded onto the service mesh.

=== Solution overview

In this module you will onboard  `travel-agency` to {ossm}. The service mesh then adds a transparent layer on the existing applications without requiring any changes to the application code. 

Service Mesh introduces an easy way to set up service-to-service authentication, complex operational functions such canary releases and telemetry to understand traffic between services. OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 uses Istio as its core service mesh implementation and includes Kiali as its observability and management console.


//  with a unified solution to manage, observe, and secure the east-west traffic of the services. It enables consistent traffic control, real-time visibility, and zero-trust security policies — all without requiring changes to the application code. With capabilities like canary deployments, {corp} can introduce new features more safely and confidently, accelerating delivery while minimizing disruption.

== Technical considerations

To successfully implement {rhossm}, there are a few key technical factors to consider:

* *Namespace and Workload Configuration*: Ensure workloads are deployed in namespaces configured for mesh participation, with sidecar injection enabled (either automatic or manual).

* *mTLS and Identity*: {rhossm} uses mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate and encrypt service-to-service traffic. Proper certificate management and identity policies are essential.

* *Authorization Policies*: Fine-grained access control can be implemented using AuthorizationPolicy CRDs to enforce least-privilege communication between services.

* *Traffic Management*: Canary deployments, traffic splitting, and fault injection require well-defined routing rules using VirtualServices and DestinationRules.

* *Observability Stack*: Tools like Kiali, Distributed Tracing, and Prometheus are included for service visualization, tracing, and metrics—ensure they are properly deployed and accessible.

These technical foundations will ensure {corp} can fully realize the benefits of {rhossm} in a production-ready environment.


=== Activities Overview:

In this module, you'll get hands-on experience with OpenShift Service Mesh. 

* Learn how OpenShift Service Mesh works by exploring its main parts. You'll see how it gives you visibility and control over how services talk to each other.

* Use zero trust security principles to make sure only the right services can access sensitive backends—helping protect your applications from unwanted access.

* Control how traffic flows between service versions so you can gradually roll out changes, reduce deployment risks, and test updates safely in production.
